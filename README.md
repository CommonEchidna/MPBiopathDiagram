Work done for Google Summer of Code 2022 with OICR (Ontario Institute for Cancer Research). All of the code in this repository was created by myself. Basic view below:

This summer, I:

Created and implemented wireframe of MP Biopath web app

Implemented graphing feture for pathways using both graphviz and cytoscapejs

Added upload file feature, and dropdown for pathway list and tab lsit to ensure they don't take up too much space

Implemented search bar for pathway and nodes based on text input and selected type (such as searching for dbid or title in the pathway list)

Created various features for graphed object (highlight edge on hover, click on node for more information, tooltip, dragging node )

Added various UI improvements on initial draft (adding logo, coloring nodes)

Added ability to add/delete/change pathways and tab selected

To do:

Improve UI further

Add Pathway Analysis section

Some features were only implemented for cytoscape, such as dragging nodes and highlighting edges, so implement them in graphviz
